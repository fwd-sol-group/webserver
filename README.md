# webserver
bash script to build ubuntu web server using nginx
I am running this in GCP using free tier compute
e2-micro Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS
https://cloud.google.com/free

Assumptions:
You have a debian based linux machine with networking preconfigured

Steps:
1. Upload to or create .sh file in directory of your choice
2. run "chmod u+x webserver.sh" from that directory. This gives executable permissions.
3. run "sudo ./webserver.sh"
4. navigate to ip address in web browser for completion
5. Smile
